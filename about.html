<h1>About Robot Shares</h1>

<p>We are at the dawn of a great new era in machine intelligence. Forces are battling over who controls this intelligence, who will be the gatekeepers of this technology. A great shift is taking place in our intelligent workforce, as AI and machines replace most tasks. This brings both challenges and great opportunities to those with the passion and foresight to seize the moment.</p>



<p>The basic idea behind Robot Shares is that machines will be enabled to act autonomously and interact with each other independent of human interference. This technology exists today with decentralized payment networks and AI agents. Imagine machines exploring distant planets, setting up their own bases, communicating with each other on resource allocation, self repair, inventing new technologies. They are bound by clear and transparent rules and rails.</p>



<p>The neatly packaged term for this is so far best labelled as the Machine to Machine Economy. Machines in an infinite number of contexts work toward very specific goals. Each machine (or bot) stores it’s own currency on-chain. Decisions are made through on-board AI agents.</p>



<p>The key to making this work is a transparent, sustainable, decentralized network. The Taraxa network provides the best combination of a rich EVM ecosystem with mature smart contracts, super fast transactions enabled by blockDAG consensus, extremely cheap transactions which are crucial for massive IOT interactions and a deep commitment to decentralization on every level.</p>



<p>For a start, for Bot0 and Bot1, we’re building a simple bot that can navigate a sandbox, reporting diagnostics, and independently interact with a charger bot. Bot0 will pay Bot1 for this charging service through the Taraxa network. We hope to have working prototypes to demonstrate this by the end of the summer 2025. The cool stuff I think will happen when we have drones travelling longer distances, providing services, interacting with other bots in the registry. One step at a time this technology will evolve.</p>
